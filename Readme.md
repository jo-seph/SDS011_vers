Implementation of NovaFitness Protocol 1.3 for SDS011 Particle Matter Sensor

for ESP8266 with arduino IDE


based on the idea of https://github.com/ricki-z/SDS011  

and 

https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/sensors-software/tree/master/airrohr-firmware

and

https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/sensors-software/blob/master/airrohr-firmware/Readme.md
but expanded to all documented functions.
